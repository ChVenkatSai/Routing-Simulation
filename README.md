# Routing-Simulation

Developed and used Distance Vector (DV) routing algorithm to simulate the control plane of the Network Layer of the OSI model. Code takes network
topology with multiple nodes (routers) as the input and implement DV routing at every node in a distributed
manner. Further tested the DV routing with different traffc settings and see how DV routing works with
time-varying link costs.
